# LifePulse AI

### Adaptive AI for Real-World Decision Making  
**Status:** Documentation-Only · **Version:** Pre-MVP  
**Focus:** Hybrid-Intelligence System (Human + AI)  
**Scope:** Personal Wellbeing Layer + Organizational Insights Layer

---

## 🌐 Overview

LifePulse AI is a **hybrid-intelligence system** designed to enhance human clarity, wellbeing,  
and performance through adaptive reasoning, contextual understanding,  
and stable long-horizon interaction patterns.

The system integrates:

- **Personal adaptive coaching**
- **Long-term behavioral trend analysis**
- **Cross-context decision support**
- **Organizational-level trend mapping** (only with explicit user consent)
- **Hybrid-intelligence interaction modeling**

LifePulse AI is *not* a medical device.  
No personal health data is uploaded, processed, or stored on external servers.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system is built on a **multi-layer adaptive model**:

1. **00-core:**  
   Foundation logic, adaptive reasoning rules, system constraints.

2. **01-engine:**  
   Behavior engine, statecharts, user-archetypes, real-time micro-interaction layer.

3. **02-governance:**  
   Data boundaries, ethics alignment, risk analysis, failure modes, governance model.

4. **03-design:**  
   Interaction design, scenario library, decision flow, user-experience structures.

5. **04-strategy:**  
   Product lines, multi-layer architecture overview, ecosystem integration logic.

6. **05-research:**  
   OII-aligned research track, methodology, evaluation metrics, long-term studies.

## 🏛 Personal Layer & Organizational Layer

LifePulse AI operates on a **dual-layer model**:

### **1) Personal Layer (Individual Use)**
- On-device adaptive agent  
- Personal wellbeing insights  
- Behavioral trend detection  
- No cloud storage  
- No external data collection  

### **2) Organizational Layer (Aggregated Insights)**  
Only activated when the user **explicitly consents**.  
Organizations (schools, companies, local governments) receive:

- *Statistical trend indicators only*
- No identity  
- No health data  
- No behavioral logs  
- No raw personal data  

This design ensures full individual privacy while enabling  
macro-level wellbeing trend mapping to support public-good decisions.

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Handling

LifePulse AI is designed with **strict safety and data boundaries**:

- No user data is uploaded  
- No cloud storage  
- No tracking  
- No behavioral logging outside local device  
- Organizations receive only aggregated, non-identifiable indicators  
- Full user opt-in required for any organizational layer output  

This ensures full alignment with:
- GDPR  
- UK Data Protection Act  
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework  
- Responsible AI principles
