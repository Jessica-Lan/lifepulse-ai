# LifePulse AI – System Architecture

LifePulse AI is designed as a hybrid-intelligence system that integrates human context, behavioral insights and adaptive AI interaction. The architecture ensures modularity, data protection and clear functional separation.

## 1. Core Architecture Layers

### **A. Data Layer (User-Side Only)**
- Local behavioral inputs (mood logs, habits, wearable patterns)
- Context signals (time, energy, activity type)
- No raw personal data is uploaded or stored on servers

*Purpose: Provide user-controlled inputs while ensuring privacy by design.*

---

### **B. Intelligence Layer**
A high-level decision engine composed of:

1. **State Recognition Module**
   - Classifies interaction context
   - Detects shifts in engagement or cognitive load

2. **Adaptive Reasoning Module**
   - Generates tailored recommendations and micro-interventions
   - Balances long-term goals and short-term constraints

3. **Behavior Profile Engine**
   - Consolidates patterns over time to refine personalization
   - Does not contain identity-level traits

---

### **C. Interaction Layer**
- Real-Time Persona Engine (separate document)
- Micro-conversation delivery
- Style adaptation
- Feedback integration

*Purpose: Deliver responses that feel intuitive, stable and aligned with user behavior.*

## 2. Key Principles
- **Local-first design**
- **No sensitive data stored**
- **Scalable modular components**
- **Separation between architecture and proprietary algorithms**
