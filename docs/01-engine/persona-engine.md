# Real-Time Persona Interaction Engine (High-Level Documentation)

The Real-Time Persona Engine enables LifePulse AI to adjust its interaction style dynamically based on the user’s context, cognitive state and behavioral patterns.

This document describes the conceptual model without revealing proprietary logic.

## 1. Purpose
To deliver interactions that feel:
- context-aware
- emotionally stable
- predictable in tone
- supportive without being intrusive

---

## 2. Input Signals (Abstracted)
- Interaction history
- Detected conversational state
- Task type (e.g., planning / reflection / decision support)
- Behavioral patterns over time
- User’s immediate cognitive load (estimated)

*No MBTI or static personality typing is used.*

## 3. Output Dimensions
The engine adjusts:
- tone (direct / reflective / concise)
- pacing
- depth of reasoning
- structure (step-by-step vs. high-level)
- motivational framing (future-oriented / constraint-based / clarity-based)
