(可切换为你选的具体方向 A/B/C)

## 2. Possible OII Alignment
- Digital life & wellbeing  
- AI governance & transparency  
- AI, work and algorithmic management  

## 3. Core Research Questions (Draft)
1. Long-term use of adaptive AI decision-support tools will change users' sense of autonomy and clarity in what ways?  
2. How can interaction design & explanation mechanisms prevent over-reliance while preserving benefits?  
3. Under what conditions does such a system function as empowerment vs. self-discipline / self-surveillance?

## 4. Methodological Direction
- Conceptual modelling based on existing architecture  
- Qualitative studies (interviews / diaries / prototyping sessions)  
- Scenario-based evaluation of interaction patterns  

## 5. Ethical & Governance Angle
- Local-first and privacy-by-design  
- Non-manipulative interaction policies  
- Evaluation metrics for autonomy-preservation
