# Behavior Engine – High-Level State Chart

States:
- Focus  
- Drift  
- Reflection  
- Constraint  
- Recovery  

Transitions:
- focus → drift (cognitive overload)
- drift → focus (micro grounding)
- reflection → focus (clarity framing)
- constraint → recovery (reassurance mode)

Output:
- style shifts
- pacing changes
- reasoning mode selection

This is an abstract conceptual model for demonstration.
