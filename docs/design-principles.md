Interactions must feel predictable and emotionally stable.

## 3. Autonomy Protection
Users remain in control.

## 4. Minimalism
Only essential information is provided.

## 5. Context Sensitivity
Responses adapt but never intrude.

## 6. Scalability
Modular architecture to support future components.
