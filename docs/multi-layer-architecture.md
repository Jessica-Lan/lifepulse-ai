# Multi-Layer Architecture (Individual → Organization → Government)

LifePulse AI operates through a three-layer hybrid-intelligence framework designed to preserve autonomy while enabling ethical, aggregate-level insights.

---

## 1. Individual Layer (Micro)
- Local-first interaction  
- Behavioral pattern recognition  
- Adaptive reasoning & clarity support  
- Personal wellbeing indicators  
- Zero data upload by default  
- Full user ownership & control

---

## 2. Organization Layer (Meso)
Activated only with explicit user consent.

Features:
- Aggregated, de-identified group trends  
- No individual-level visibility  
- Workload patterns  
- Wellbeing shifts  
- Cognitive load clusters  
- Team-level adaptation insights  

Purpose:
Support organizational decision-making without surveillance or personal profiling.

---

## 3. Government / Public Sector Layer (Macro)
- Population-level trend indicators  
- Early detection of broad wellbeing shifts  
- High-level policy insights  
- No traceable data (organization or individual)  

Designed for:
- Public health  
- Educational wellbeing  
- Workforce planning  
- Social resilience analysis

## Ethical Principle
**Individual → Organization → Government  
is a gradient of decreasing granularity and increasing abstraction.**

The system never reverses this gradient.

This architecture ensures LifePulse AI enhances clarity, resilience, and wellbeing while remaining ethically aligned and privacy-protective.
