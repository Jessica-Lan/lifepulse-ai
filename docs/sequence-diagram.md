## Detailed Flow (Abstract)

1. User sends query  
2. Interaction Layer captures context  
3. State Recognition classifies user state  
4. Reasoning module selects reasoning mode  
5. Persona Engine selects interaction style  
6. Response delivered  
7. Feedback loop updates interaction memory  

This diagram excludes proprietary logic and focuses on conceptual flow only.
